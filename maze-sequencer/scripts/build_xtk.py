"""Build addon/Force Maze Seq Control.xtk -- a Force track template that
pre-assigns 16 Q-Link knobs (Force's physical knob bank) to the CCs from
docs/CC-MAP.md, so loading it onto a MIDI track gets you named,
correctly-ranged knobs instead of hand MIDI-learning each one.

Same reverse-engineered .xtk format as force-acid/scripts/build_xtk.py (see
that script's own header comment for the full story and caveats) --
xtk-seed.json here is the identical seed file, copied verbatim: it's
structural/schema material (mixer defaults, empty pad banks), not anything
specific to any one module's generation logic, so it's shared byte-for-byte
across every module in this org that ships a track template.

CAVEAT: reverse-engineered from one sample file, NOT YET CONFIRMED to load
correctly in the Force's UI on a real screen -- see docs/capture-xtk.md.

LEFTOVER-DATA FIX (ported from force-acid's own build_xtk.py, found there by
on-device inspection): the shared seed's `customQLinks` was always fully
overwritten, but `data.program.customisable.mapping` (127 entries) was not
-- it's a leftover automation-parameter-name catalog from a *different*
addon's own generator engine (its `name` fields read like "1 Mode 0-25 (1
Cluster 0-59)"), and `midiInputRoute`/`midiOutputRoute` pointed at
"Mockba Harpie 4T" / referenced that same donor addon's own ALSA client,
not this project's ("Mockba Maze Seq", see src/host_shim.cpp's --client
default). `blank_mapping()`/`fix_midi_routes()` below scrub both; `audit()`
refuses to build if any leftover donor-addon string survives.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/build_xtk.py                            # -> addon/Force Maze Seq Control.xtk (+ .xtk.json)
    python3 scripts/build_xtk.py --track-name "MY TRACK"     # if you don't use "MAZE SEQ CTRL"
    python3 scripts/build_xtk.py --pack path/to/edited.json --out "addon/Force Maze Seq Control.xtk"
        # skip seed/KNOBS generation entirely -- just re-pack an already-assembled
        # (and possibly hand-edited) JSON dump back into .xtk framing.

    REAL-HARDWARE FINDING: this table, not customQLinks, is what the
    Force's on-screen custom-knob page actually renders. automationIndex is
    a MIDI CC number (the donor addon's own real CC scheme), and `name` is
    that CC's display label. Confirmed by comparing a live screenshot of an
    unmodified donor track (correct custom names) against ours (showing
    "CC 24", "CC 29" etc. with the donor's own leftover *values*) -- Force
    falls back to a built-in MIDI-standard name (CC 11 = "Expression") or a
    bare "CC <n>" label whenever `name` is empty, which is what merely
    blanking `name` on every entry produced. See force-acid's build_xtk.py
    for the full writeup.

    The only correct fix is to actually populate this table with our own CC
    numbers and labels, and blank every other slot to the file's own
    "unused slot" shape (automationIndex sentinel, name/value empty) so no
    donor CCs or names survive either.

    COVERAGE: this table has 127 slots and isn't limited to one Q-Link
    bank's 16 knobs the way customQLinks is -- the web GUI exposes every CC
    the host listens to, so this on-screen page should too. The first 16
    slots get the Q-Link-covered CCs in KNOBS, reordered for correct
    top-to-bottom reading on page 1 (hardware-confirmed -- see
    display_order()); every other CC the host has (parsed straight out of
    its own PARAMS[] table via parse_host_params(), never hand-copied, so
    it can't drift) fills the remaining slots after that, in the host's own
    table order. Whether the same bottom-up-per-page quirk applies to pages
    beyond the first isn't hardware-confirmed -- if page 2+ reads bottom-up
    on a real screen too, apply display_order() to chunks of those as well.
