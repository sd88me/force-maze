# ForceMazeVoice — deliberately a no-op (2026-09-13).
#
# This addon no longer arms any LD_PRELOAD tap or auto-starts maze_host at
# boot - that's ForceAudioIn's job now (see its own README.md), and
# maze_host is only ever started on demand via the nodeServer Modules page
# (/moduler), never at boot. NSMODULE.json also sets AUTOLAUNCHABLE:false
# for this reason.
#
# This file still exists, as a harmless stub, only because nodeServer's
# moduler endpoint names its own optional "Autoload" copy target after
# PROCESSNAME (run_maze_host.sh) - if that toggle is ever set despite
# AUTOLAUNCHABLE:false, having this file present and inert is safer than
# it failing to find a file to copy. It intentionally does nothing at all,
# on every invocation, "kill" included.
